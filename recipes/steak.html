        <h4>Grilled Tomahawk Steak</h4>
        <P>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family.</P>
        <p>This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives.</p>
        <p>I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
                <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Compound Butter:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced shallot</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>

            <h4>Directions(Steps)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong> Step: 1</strong> <br>
                To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder
                in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. <br>Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.</li>
                <li> <strong>Step: 2</strong> <br>
                Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub
                until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Step: 3</strong> <br>
                For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl.
                Mash together with a fork until evenly combined. <br>Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and
                refrigerate until ready to use.
                <li> <strong>Step: 4</strong> <br>
                Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan
                that you used for dry-brining.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Step: 5</strong> <br>
                Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak,
                so you will need an instant-read thermometer.<br>If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To make this an easy meal, I like to serve the steak on a platter of baked rice, and a chopped wedge salad with
            Bob's Blue Cheese Dressing! You can make the baked rice the day before, <br>then reheat it with your steak. And the wedge
            salad can be assembled in the morning, and kept in the fridge until you're ready to serve.</h4>
